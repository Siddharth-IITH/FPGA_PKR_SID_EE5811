# FPGA_PKR_SID_EE5811

Abstract:
Image processing is the means by which the input
image is modified by one or more mathematical
algorithms to generate an output image that is
enhanced in some way. For example, edges may be
enhanced or the noise reduced. Image processing is
often used to prepare images prior to analysis. In the
following work, we will be doing colour inversion
of the image using FPGA and Arduino board.
